book = {
  "description": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic shot of a pop-up storybook that comes to life. A whimsical, fairytale cottage and forest scene made of papercraft rises from the pages under a magical night sky.",
  "mood": "Magical, whimsical, enchanting, cozy, dreamlike.",
  "camera": "Slow Arc and Push-In",
  "lens": "35mm Macro Lens",
  "aperture": "f/2.8",
  "position": "Starts with a medium, slightly high-angle shot, looking down at the open book. The camera then slowly arcs and pushes in, moving closer to the cottage and revealing the depth of the paper layers.",
  "movement": "A smooth, gentle, and continuous camera move that feels like someone is leaning in to get a closer look at a magical diorama.",
  "environment": {
    "location": "An open storybook resting on a dark, unseen surface.",
    "pop_up_scene": {
      "materials": "The entire scene is made from high-quality, multi-layered cardstock with a matte, textured finish. The PBR materials show subtle paper grain, slight folds, and crisp, die-cut edges.",
      "cottage": "A charming, Tudor-style cottage with a steep, scalloped roof and glowing yellow windows. The windows are made of a translucent vellum paper, creating a soft, warm light.",
      "flora": "Layers of papercraft trees (pines and aspens), intricate flowers, and mossy ground cover create a dense, miniature forest.",
      "fauna": "Various papercraft animals (a deer, a bear, a fox) and whimsical forest sprites are positioned around the scene.",
      "sky": "A deep indigo night sky, also made of paper, with a crescent moon and tiny, star-shaped cutouts that have a faint, silvery glint."

    "type": "Soft Moonlight",
    "position": "From a high angle, mimicking the paper moon.",
    "color_temperature": "9000K (Cool, silvery-blue light)",
    "intensity": "Very low, just enough to gently illuminate the entire scene and provide a subtle contrast to the warm cottage light."

  },
"animation": {
  "pop_up_effect": "This is the central animation. Over the first 3 seconds, the cottage and surrounding scenery rise smoothly from the flat pages of the book, unfolding layer by layer into their final 3D positions. The movement is flawless and magical.",
  "subtle_effects": "From 3.0s to 8.0s, the paper characters exhibit almost imperceptible, subtle movements, as if animated by a magical breeze. A character might slightly turn its head, or a tree might gently sway. Tiny, glowing firefly-like particles, made of light, begin to drift up from the book's pages, swirling slowly through the scene."
